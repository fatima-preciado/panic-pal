## Description

Innovative mobile application designed to provide immediate support during moments of panic and anxiety. Our app enables users to engage in text-based conversations with a Generative AI, leveraging advanced language models such as Llama.

## Key Features

- **Instant Support:** Chat with the Generative AI to receive guidance and assistance when experiencing a panic attack.

- **Adaptability:** Our AI is not static; it can evolve and expand its capabilities over time. This includes training it to handle new situations effectively.
- **Connect with Loved Ones:** The app can be configured to reach out to trusted contacts or loved ones in the event of an emergency, ensuring that help is always within reach.
- **Personalization:** After assisting users in calming and grounding techniques, the chatbot seeks feedback to continually refine its responses and tailor its support for maximum benefit to each individual.
